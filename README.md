# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project I practiced creating an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI, I acquired this knowledge from Udacity Web Development Professional Track.

## Steps

Setting up project environment, making sure I have Node and packages installed, and included in my server.js file.
1. I installed the Node packages needed(express, body-parser, cors) and included them in 'server.js' file.

2. I set up the GET and POST routes needed to build my server in 'server.js' file.

3. I created the needed async functions to fetch the weather data, store it in my local server, then update the App UI dynamically using vanilla JavaScript.
